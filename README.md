# Startup Namer

You’ll implement a simple mobile app that generates proposed names for a startup company. The user can select and unselect names, saving the best ones. The code lazily generates names. As the user scrolls, more names are generated. There is no limit to how far a user can scroll.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

#### What you'll learn in part 1
 - How to write a Flutter app that looks natural on iOS, Android, and the web.
 - Basic structure of a Flutter app.
 - Finding and using packages to extend functionality.
 - Using hot reload for a quicker development cycle.
 - How to implement a stateful widget.
 - How to create an infinite, lazily loaded list.
 
In [part 2](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2/) of this codelab, you’ll add interactivity, modify the app’s theme, and add the ability to navigate to a new screen (called a route in Flutter).

#### What you'll use
You need two pieces of software to complete this lab: the [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and [an editor](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor). This codelab assumes Android Studio, but you can use your preferred editor.

You can run this codelab using any of the following devices:

 - A physical device (Android or iOS) connected to your computer and set to developer mode
 - The [iOS simulator](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos#set-up-the-ios-emulator)
 - The [Android emulator](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos#set-up-the-android-emulator)
 - A browser (Chrome is required for debugging)

### To run the application on any device (Android & iOS);
 - Open your terminal
 - Navigate to project root folder _(e.g. %USERPROFILE%/FlutterProject/startup_namer)_
 - Type `flutter run` and run
 - The build should not take more than 7 mins.
 
_PS: Ensure you have the Android SDK installed, in order test the app on android devices._
